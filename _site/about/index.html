<h2 id="what-is-poemaday">What is poemADAY</h2>

<p>Poemaday <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(poem a day/a poem a day)</code> well, is not a very creative and out of the box name but it is what the name suggests. I built this blog to post one poem every day (written by someone else) and talk about it. I know, what a drab! But I assure you, it’s nothing like “YouTube reaction videos”. My plan is not to leech off of other people’s art. I simply wish to talk about poems and poets that come from all walks of life. Mainly, I want to focus on <strong>South Asian poets</strong> and then branch off from there.</p>

<h2 id="why-poemaday">Why poemADAY</h2>

<p>To be honest, I’m not a very honest person (<em>Woah, what a loop</em>). I’m also not a very bold person. I am meek as far as internet “<strong>speak up/ speak about</strong>” goes. While I was growing up, poetry wasn’t taught very religiously in my school, nor did I have parents who give their kids “books” to read so there was simply no way of discovering poetry. I, along with numerous students in those schools missed out on poetry and somehow it wasn’t the end of the world. Passing on poetry doesn’t limit your chances of becoming an engineer or a doctor, or a lawyer in India. But it caught on with me. Something about the verses irked me. And so, like a little Alice I decided to delve into the wonder pit of poetry and when I came out, I only had lots and lots of strange awe for it.</p>

<p>What was more irksome is how poets all over the world have been writing these very interesting pieces and somehow I didn’t know how to understand them, or even how to consume them. We were simply never taught how to approach strange beings of poetry. So, this blog is a feverish attempt to understand poems by writing about them. What better way to learn something than teaching it (after learning)? There’s however a small hiccup. Remember how I said I am not a very bold person? Yes. So, it’s very difficult for me to talk about something that isn’t written by me. It’s that dreadful imposter syndrome and I want to rise above it. I feel like there’s a certain way one is supposed to talk and write about things (the internet way) and since I’ve always felt like a very unintuitive person, I regularly put off that task. But now, I wish to overcome that fear and learn how to write about things, in <strong>my own way</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="therefore-i-assure-you-this-is-the-last-conclusion">Therefore, (I assure you this is the last conclusion)</h2>

<p>So birthed, <strong>poemADAY</strong>. For skimmers, let me just very carefully enlist what poemADAY wants to achieve.</p>

  <li>Learn to understand poetry</li>
  <li>Enjoy reading poetry (thus, develop a reading habit)</li>

  <li>Develop space to express thoughts on poetry</li>
  <li>Make email-friends</li>

</ol>
