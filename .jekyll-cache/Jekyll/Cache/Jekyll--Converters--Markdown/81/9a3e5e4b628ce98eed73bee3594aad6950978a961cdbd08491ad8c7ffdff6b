I"e<p>The title is the most interesting part with the promise of an end goalâ€“happiness. The poem breaks out into a very poetic list of things that you are advised to do. I wonder if each of these things in the list carry an individual power to make you happy or whether only upon the completion of all the tasks in the list, could you achieve happiness.</p>
